# MCP SSE Server Research Notes
## Current Understanding
### Existing Setup
- Multiple MCP tools currently running via stdio transport
- Each tool requires individual npm installation on startup
- Tools run as separate processes
- Startup delay occurs due to npm installations and process initialization
- Approximately 8 tools causing startup delays in Goose/Cline/Claude Desktop
### SSE vs stdio Transport
1. stdio Transport (Current):
   - Requires process initialization per tool
   - Needs npm installation per startup
   - Direct process communication
   - Supported natively by Claude Desktop
2. SSE Transport (Potential):
   - Single persistent server connection
   - Multiple tools through one connection
   - No repeated npm installations
   - Faster startup (server already running)
   - Requires custom hosting solution
## Implementation Requirements
### Server Requirements
1. Technical Requirements:
   - Long-running connections support
   - Persistent HTTP connections
   - Concurrent connection handling
   - No serverless platform limitations
   - Proper timeout configuration
2. Infrastructure Requirements:
   - Traditional VPS or dedicated server
   - Support for persistent processes
   - Adequate memory for connection pool
   - Network capacity for sustained connections
### Hosting Considerations
1. Suitable Platforms:
   - Traditional VPS providers (DigitalOcean, Linode)
   - Dedicated servers
   - Cloud VM instances (AWS EC2, Google Compute Engine)
   - Self-hosted solutions
2. Unsuitable Platforms:
   - Serverless platforms (Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare Functions)
   - Platforms with connection timeouts
   - Shared hosting with connection limits
### Implementation Options
1. SvelteKit Implementation:
   - Native SSE support
   - TypeScript support
   - Familiar ecosystem
   - Requires proper hosting platform
2. Connection Management:
   - Need reconnection handling
   - Error recovery
   - Connection pool management
   - Multiple tool routing
## Technical Considerations
### SSE Limitations
- Browser connection limits per domain
- Proxy server limitations
- One-way communication (server to client)
- Text-based protocol overhead
### Scaling Considerations
- Connection pool size
- Memory usage per connection
- Network bandwidth requirements
- Tool isolation and management
## Next Steps
### Investigation Needed
1. Detailed implementation testing
   - Connection management
   - Tool routing
   - Error handling
   - Performance metrics
2. Hosting platform evaluation
   - Cost comparison
   - Performance testing
   - Scaling requirements
   - Maintenance needs
3. Security considerations
   - Authentication
   - Authorization
   - Data protection
   - Network security
### Implementation Plan
1. Create proof of concept
2. Test with single tool
3. Expand to multiple tools
4. Performance testing
5. Production deployment
## Open Questions
1. How to handle tool-specific requirements?
2. What's the optimal connection pooling strategy?
3. How to manage tool updates and versioning?
4. What's the impact on Claude Desktop compatibility?
5. How to handle connection recovery and state management?
